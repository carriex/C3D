# C3D
Pytorch implementation of [Learning Spatialtemporal Features with 3D Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.0767.pdf) with temporal depth *d=3*. 

## The model 
C3D is a Convolution Neural Network with a 3 dimensional (3 x 3 x 3) kernel which learns spatial-temporal information across multiple frames in the same video clip. 

## Requirement 
1. Pytorch 1.0 or above 
2. OpenCV 4.1 or above
3. Python 3.6 or above 

## Prerequisites 

1. Clone the repo 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/carriex/C3D.git
```

2. Install the python dependency packages 
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

# C3D
Pytorch implementation of [Learning Spatialtemporal Features with 3D Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.0767.pdf) with temporal depth *d=3*. 

## The model 
C3D is a Convolution Neural Network with a 3 dimensional (3 x 3 x 3) kernel which learns spatial-temporal information across multiple frames in the same video clip. 

## Requirement 
1. Pytorch 1.0 or above 
2. OpenCV 4.1 or above
